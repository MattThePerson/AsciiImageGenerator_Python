# AsciiImageGenerator_Python

Tool for converting images to ascii-art (not really art but nvm that). 

### How to use:
- Can choose font, font size, as well as the block size of each monospaced character (eg 12x7 for 12pt). 
- Can choose to generate an 'inverted' image, where the text is white on a black background.
- Can also scale the image to be filtered by integer factor to allow for larger font sizes and better looking 
writing (when you zoom in). 
- Can chose basically any set of characters to generate ascii image from. Default is ascii characters between
32 and 127. 
- Can save images by running correct cell. Filename automatically generated. 
- Can open image in separate window.
- Can print out ascii text (to be copied)
